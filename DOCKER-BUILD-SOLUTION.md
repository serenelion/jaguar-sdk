# Docker Build Solution for Jaguar SDK

## Issue Analysis
The Jaguar SDK Docker build is failing because Next.js binary cannot be found at `/app/node_modules/next/dist/bin/next`. This suggests either:
1. Next.js isn't being installed properly
2. The binary path is different
3. Dependencies are being installed but not accessible

## Immediate Solution for Dokploy Deployment

Since we need to get this working for Digital Ocean deployment via Dokploy, I'll implement a working solution:

### Option 1: Add Jaguar SDK to Dokploy without Docker Build
Update the existing `docker-compose-dokploy.yml` to exclude the problematic Jaguar SDK service and deploy it separately.

### Option 2: Fix Docker Build with Simplified Approach
Create a working Dockerfile that bypasses the complex build issues.

## Current Status
- ✅ OpenWebUI: Working with GitHub Actions
- ✅ Tool Server: Working with GitHub Actions  
- ❌ Jaguar SDK: Docker build failing

## Recommended Approach
For immediate Dokploy deployment, we should:
1. Deploy OpenWebUI and Tool Server (already working)
2. Run Jaguar SDK locally or fix the Docker build separately
3. Add Jaguar SDK to Dokploy once Docker build is resolved

This ensures the core functionality (AI chat with GitHub integration) is deployed while we resolve the Next.js build issues.
