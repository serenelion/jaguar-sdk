## 🤖 AI Agent Capabilities

### Code Analysis Agent
```bash
# Via API
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/github/analyze/owner/repo"

# Via Chat
"Analyze the codebase structure of my repository"
```

### Issue Management Agent
```bash
# Create self-development task
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/github/self-development/task" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "owner": "your-username",
    "repo": "your-repo",
    "task_type": "improvement",
    "title": "Optimize database queries",
    "description": "Analyze and improve slow database operations",
    "priority": "high"
  }'
```

### Repository Reading Agent
```bash
# Read any file from GitHub
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/github/repo/owner/repo/files/path/to/file.py"
```

## 🧪 Testing the Self-Development Workflow

### 1. **Code Analysis**
Ask the AI: *"Analyze this monorepo and identify areas for improvement"*

The AI will:
- Read the repository structure
- Analyze code patterns and dependencies
- Identify potential optimizations
- Generate improvement suggestions

### 2. **Issue Creation**
Ask the AI: *"Create GitHub issues for the improvements you identified"*

The AI will:
- Create structured GitHub issues
- Add appropriate labels and priorities
- Include file references and acceptance criteria
- Assign to appropriate development tracks

### 3. **Workflow Triggering**
Ask the AI: *"Trigger the development workflow for high-priority issues"*

The AI will:
- Trigger GitHub Actions workflows
- Assign issues to GitHub Copilot
- Monitor progress and provide updates
- Coordinate multi-agent development tasks

## 📊 Monitoring & Health Checks

### Service Health
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "services": {
    "github": "connected",
    "supabase": "connected"
  }
}
```

### GitHub API Status
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/rate_limit
```

## 🔮 Self-Development in Action

### Example Conversation with AI

**Human**: "Analyze this monorepo and create improvement issues"

**AI**: "I'll analyze the codebase structure and create GitHub issues for improvements..."

1. **Analyzes repository** using `/github/analyze/owner/repo`
2. **Reads key files** using `/github/repo/owner/repo/files/...`
3. **Identifies improvements** based on code analysis
4. **Creates GitHub issues** using `/github/self-development/task`
5. **Reports results** with issue numbers and links

**Human**: "Trigger development workflows for the critical issues"

**AI**: "I'll trigger GitHub Actions workflows for the high-priority issues..."

1. **Lists created issues** using `/github/repo/owner/repo/issues`
2. **Filters by priority** (critical, high)
3. **Triggers workflows** using `/github/repo/owner/repo/workflow/id/dispatch`
4. **Monitors progress** and provides updates

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Local Development
```bash
# Start development environment
pnpm dev

# Work on specific packages
pnpm --filter ai-open-agents dev
pnpm --filter jaguar-sdk dev

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Build everything
pnpm build
```

### Adding New AI Tools
1. Add endpoint to `packages/ai-open-agents/tools/main.py`
2. Implement logic in `packages/ai-open-agents/tools/python/utils/`
3. Update OpenAPI documentation
4. Test via `/docs` interface
5. Test via OpenWebUI chat

### Phase 2: Enhancement (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] Add more sophisticated code analysis
- [ ] Implement automated testing integration
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Create learning algorithms for agent improvement

### Phase 3: AGI Evolution (1-3 months)
- [ ] Multi-repository management
- [ ] Cross-project learning and knowledge transfer
- [ ] Autonomous feature development
- [ ] Advanced AI-to-AI collaboration protocols

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"GitHub API rate limit exceeded"**
```bash
# Check your rate limit
curl -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/rate_limit
```

**"Tool server not responding"**
```bash
# Check if Python dependencies are installed
cd packages/ai-open-agents/tools
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the server manually
python3 main.py
```

**"OpenWebUI can't connect to tools"**
- Ensure `TOOL_SERVER_API_KEY` matches in both services
- Check that tool server is running on port 8000
- Verify Docker network connectivity

## 🎉 Success Metrics

You'll know the self-development system is working when:

1. **AI can read its own code**: Ask "What files are in this repository?" ✅
2. **AI creates meaningful issues**: Ask "Create improvement issues" ✅
3. **AI triggers workflows**: Ask "Start development on critical issues" ✅
4. **AI learns from results**: Monitor issue completion and quality improvements ✅
