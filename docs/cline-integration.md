# Cline Integration Guide

## Overview

Jaguar SDK v1 is built with [Cline](https://docs.cline.bot), the AI-powered VS Code extension that revolutionizes development workflows. This guide covers everything you need to know about developing with Jaguar SDK using Cline.

## What is Cline?

Cline is an AI coding assistant that can:

- Write, edit, and debug code
- Execute terminal commands
- Browse files and understand project structure
- Create entire applications from natural language descriptions
- Integrate with your development workflow seamlessly

## Quick Setup

### 1. Install VS Code

Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### 2. Install Cline Extension

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
3. Search for "Cline"
4. Click Install

### 3. Configure API Key

Cline works with various AI providers. For Jaguar SDK development, we recommend:

- **xAI (Grok)** - Excellent for coding tasks
- **Anthropic Claude** - Great for complex reasoning
- **OpenAI GPT-4** - Reliable general-purpose option

## Jaguar SDK Development with Cline

### Project Structure Setup

When starting a new Jaguar SDK project, use this folder structure:

```
Documents/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Cline/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ jaguar-projects/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ my-first-agent/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ regenerative-app/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ community-platform/
```

### Effective Prompting for Jaguar SDK

#### üéØ **Setup Prompts**

```
Help me set up a new Jaguar SDK project with:
- Supabase database configuration
- xAI API integration
- Permaculture ethics framework
- Modern React components
```

#### ü§ñ **Agent Development Prompts**

```
Create an AI agent for [specific purpose] that:
- Follows permaculture ethics (Earth Care, People Care, Fair Share)
- Uses the Jaguar SDK architecture
- Includes proper error handling
- Has comprehensive tests
```

#### üå± **Regenerative Project Prompts**

```
Build a regenerative [type] application that:
- Tracks environmental impact
- Promotes community collaboration
- Uses sustainable development practices
- Integrates with the Spatial Network
```

### Cline Best Practices for Jaguar SDK

#### 1. **Context-Aware Development**

Always provide Cline with context about:

- Project goals and ethics
- Target users and use cases
- Technical constraints
- Permaculture principles

#### 2. **Iterative Development**

Use Cline's Plan & Act mode for complex features:

```
Plan: Create a conscious AI agent marketplace
- Design database schema
- Build API endpoints
- Create React components
- Add ethics validation
- Implement testing

Act: Let's start with the database schema
```

#### 3. **Ethics-First Approach**

Always include ethical considerations:

```
Ensure this feature considers:
- Environmental impact
- User privacy and data protection
- Community benefit
- Long-term sustainability
```

## Advanced Cline Techniques

### 1. **Multi-File Coordination**

Cline can work across multiple files simultaneously:

```
Update the agent configuration in config/agents.ts and create corresponding React components in components/agents/ with proper TypeScript types
```

### 2. **Database Integration**

Leverage Cline for database operations:

```
Create a Drizzle schema for tracking regenerative projects with fields for carbon impact, community involvement, and sustainability metrics
```

### 3. **Testing Automation**

Use Cline to generate comprehensive tests:

```
Create Jest tests for the permaculture ethics validation system, including edge cases and integration tests
```

## Cline + Jaguar SDK Workflows

### üöÄ **New Project Workflow**

1. **Initialize Project**

   ```
   Create a new Jaguar SDK project called [project-name] with full setup including database, authentication, and basic agent framework
   ```

2. **Configure Ethics**

   ```
   Set up permaculture ethics validation for all AI interactions in this project
   ```

3. **Build Core Features**

   ```
   Implement [specific features] following Jaguar SDK patterns and best practices
   ```

4. **Add Testing**
   ```
   Create comprehensive tests for all components including ethics compliance checks
   ```

### üîß **Debugging Workflow**

1. **Identify Issue**

   ```
   I'm getting [error message] when [specific action]. Help me debug this issue.
   ```

2. **Analyze Code**

   ```
   Review the [component/function] and identify potential issues with [specific area]
   ```

3. **Implement Fix**
   ```
   Fix the identified issue and add error handling to prevent similar problems
   ```

### üåç **Deployment Workflow**

1. **Prepare for Production**

   ```
   Optimize this Jaguar SDK application for production deployment including performance optimizations and security hardening
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**

   ```
   Set up environment variables and configuration for [deployment target]
   ```

3. **Deploy and Monitor**
   ```
   Create deployment scripts and monitoring setup for the application
   ```

## Cline Rules for Jaguar SDK
