 * 1. Clone https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js.git
 * 2. Run `protos:generate` in `experimental/packages/otlp-proto-exporter-base/`
 * 3. Fork `experimental/packages/otlp-proto-exporter-base/src/generated/root.js` and inline all encode methods. Throw away the rest of the code.
 *
 * The OTLP protocol is very stable, so these steps would only need to be done rarely.
